Question 1
10.times { |x| puts (' ' * x) + "The Flintstones Rock!" }

Question 2
This returns an error because it is trying to combine a string and a Fixnum. You can fix it in a couple of different ways:
puts "the value of 40 + 2 is #{40 + 2}"
puts "the value of 40 + 2 is " + (40 + 2).to_s

Question 3
def factors(number)
  dividend = number
  divisors = []
  while dividend > 0
    divisors << number / dividend if number % dividend == 0
    dividend -= 1
  end
  divisors
end

  Bonus 1
  The purpose of expression number % dividend == 0 is to determine if the number can be evenly divided by the dividend, i.e., where the remainder is 0.

  Bonus 2
  The purpose of the line divisors is to return the value of divisors. This is then printed by the puts statement I added to test the code.

Question 4
Using << will mutate buffer, while using + will not actually change the value of buffer.

Question 5
Either assign the value of limit inside the method, or make limit a constant LIMIT and change the variable limit in the method to LIMIT.

Question 6
